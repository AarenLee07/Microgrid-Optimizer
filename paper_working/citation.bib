abstract = {The extensive substitution of fossil fuels with renewables creates the U-shaped demand curve (duck curve) problem which is exacerbated in the summer months with the extensive use of air-conditioning. This study examines the hourly, daily, and yearly operation of a cluster of one hundred grid-independent buildings that completely rely on photovoltaics for electricity generation, including their air-conditioning needs. The cluster stores energy in hydrogen as the seasonal storage medium and chilled water for cooling as the daily storage medium. Thermal storage of chilled water and the use of efficient air-conditioning (refrigeration) equipment significantly reduces the needs for the generated electric energy and stored energy: The utilization of thermal storage in addition to chemical storage has three beneficial results: a) it reduces by about 40% the needed solar power installation; b) it reduces by a factor of three the losses associated with energy storage; and c) it reduces by factor of four the necessary hydrogen storage capacity. The improved performance of the system is expected to significantly reduce the overall cost associated with grid independent buildings.}

Existing planning methods have flaws in terms of optimality or computational efficiency due to their lack of in-depth consideration about optimal charge depletion behaviors. To address this issue, rigorous theoretical analysis on the aggregated local and global optimal charge depletion behaviors in energy domain is conducted by combining Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle-based analytical derivations and some qualitative reasoning. Fundamental understanding on how the optimal charge depletion rates behave in different driving conditions and why they exhibit such behaviors is provided. The theoretical analysis is further validated through model-in-the-loop tests using an experimentally validated high-fidelity vehicle simulator. The insights gained from the analysis of this paper establish a fundamental knowledge foundation and may pave a new path for more scientific PEM design in the future.}

The control strategy is based on the integration of optimal generation scheduling with a model predictive control in order to achieve both long and short-term optimal planning. In particular, long-term optimization of the various microgrid components is obtained by the adoption of an optimal generation scheduling, in which a statistical approach is used to take into account weather and load forecasting uncertainties. The real-time management of the microgrid is instead entrusted to a model predictive controller, which has the important feature of using the results obtained by the optimal generation scheduling. The proposed control strategy was tested in a laboratory-scale microgrid present at the University of Seville, which is composed of an electronic power source that emulates a photovoltaic system, a battery bank and a hydrogen production and storage system. Two different experimental tests that simulate a summer and a winter day were carried out over a 24-h period to verify the reliability and performance enhancement of the control system. Results show an effective improvement in performance in terms of reduction of the microgrid operating cost and greater involvement of the hydrogen storage system for the maintenance of a spinning reserve in batteries.}

abstract = {Thermal energy storage (TES) systems allow concentrated solar power (CSP) producers to participate in a day-ahead market. Therefore, the optimal power scheduling problem can be posed, whose objective is the maximization of profits derived from electricity sales. The daily generation schedule has to be offered in advance, usually the previous day before a certain time, thus an electricity price and weather forecast must be carried out. This paper proposes a model-based predictive control (MPC) approach for optimal scheduling in CSP plants. This approach has a dual purpose: (1) the periodic update of the generation schedule to track the schedule that has been committed to by means of the most recent electricity price and weather forecast and information about the plant state and (2) the generation of the optimal schedule for the next day. As these two tasks are related, they are performed simultaneously. Therefore, the MPC sliding window is composed of a first time interval to track the committed schedule and a second time interval to generate the next schedule for the following hours. This is then offered as the generation schedule for the next day at the appropriate time. The proposed approach is applied, in a simulation context, to a 50MW parabolic trough collector-based CSP plant with molten-salt-based TES. The chosen criterion to track the committed schedule is the even distribution of the possible generation error within the first interval. A case-study with overestimated initial DNI forecast is undertaken. The results show that the MPC control with short-term DNI forecast significantly improves the above-mentioned objective and allows for a reduction of the deviation from the scheduled generation, when compared with the case without short-term DNI forecast.}

abstract = {The increasing use of renewable energy in buildings requires optimization of building demand flexibility to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions. Nevertheless, the optimization process is generally challenging that needs to consider the on-site intermittent energy supply, dynamic building energy demand, and proper utilization of energy storage systems. Leveraging the growing availability of operational data in buildings, data-driven strategies such as reinforcement learning (RL) have emerged as effective approaches to optimizing building demand flexibility. However, training a reliable RL agent is practically data-demanding and time-consuming, limiting its practical applicability. This study proposes a new strategy that integrates a rule-based expert system (RBES) and RL agents into the decision-making process to jointly reduce building energy costs, minimize the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of grid power, and maximize PV self-consumption. In this strategy, the RBES determines system operation directly in less complex decision-making scenarios, while, in more intricate decision-making environments, it provides a reference decision for RL to explore optimal solutions further. This integration empowers RL agents to avoid unnecessary exploration and significantly enhance learning efficiency. The proposed strategy was tested using PV generation data and energy consumption data of a low energy office building. The results demonstrated an 85.7% improvement in RL learning efficiency and this strategy can successfully avoid sub-optimal convergence during policy learning. Compared to relying solely on the RBES, the proposed strategy led to 5.4% and 19.2% reductions in the electricity costs and daily PAR of grid power at peak hours, respectively. The strategy also achieved a satisfying PV self-consumption ratio of 62.4%, which is merely 0.4% lower than the optimal value determined by the RBES strategy that prioritized maximizing PV self-consumption. Additionally, compared with a model predictive control method developed for cost reduction, the strategy achieved similar cost savings while significantly reducing the decision time.}

In this paper, we present a holistic, data-driven framework to determine the optimal investment, size and controller of a battery storage system providing frequency control. We optimised the controller towards minimum degradation and electricity costs over its lifetime, while ensuring the delivery of frequency control services compliant with regulatory requirements. We adopted a detailed battery model, considering the dynamics and degradation when exposed to actual frequency data. Further, we used a stochastic optimisation objective while constraining the probability on unavailability to deliver the frequency control service. Through a thorough analysis, we were able to decrease the amount of data needed and thereby decrease the execution time while keeping the approximation error within limits. Using the proposed framework, we performed a techno-economic analysis of a battery providing 1 MW capacity in the German primary frequency control market. Results showed that a battery rated at 1.6 MW, 1.6 MWh has the highest net present value, yet this configuration is only profitable if costs are low enough or in case future frequency control prices do not decline too much. It transpires that calendar ageing drives battery degradation, whereas cycle ageing has less impact.}

In particular, solar photovoltaics (PV) paired with Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) will provide a suitable option for continuous power supply as their investment costs continue to decline during the next decade. An opportunity arises to use the plant’s energy resources to provide grid services without hindering hydrogen production. Motivated by this, this paper presents a chance-constrained stochastic model for the optimal operation scheduling of a PV-BESS-Electrolyzer system participating in energy and ancillary services markets. Scenarios are used to account for uncertainty in solar power availability and energy content of the frequency regulation signal, and a degradation model is included to properly consider the effect of repeated battery cycling. Computational experiments using PJM market data and a realistic time frame show the benefits of the proposed model, achieving 10.2% more profits than the deterministic benchmark problem, while maintaining low failure rates in the provision of the regulation service and a similar hydrogen production compared to an off-grid standalone operation.}

In the last years, the Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm has proved to be capable of identifying the optimal policy once the definition of a proper computational grid is performed. As far as the refinement of the latter is concerned, the results produced by the selected control strategy can be negatively affected by a rough mesh due to approximation errors chains. Still, too fine a grid can lead to unreasonable CPU times. Hence, a method for automatically detecting the optimal mesh discretization with respect to different HEV simulations should be found. In the present paper, a self-adaptive statistical approach based on a proper management of any admissible battery energy variation is developed to significantly improve the calculation times required for HEV architectures while still attaining the best possible accuracy in terms of CO2 emissions as well as total cost of ownership (TCO). For the purpose, a low-throughput battery model has been taken into account so that the number of cells, the curve power limit and the energy content could be accounted for. The proposed method was tested on two parallel HEVs belonging to different categories, specifically a passenger car and a heavy-duty vehicle. The robustness of the method was also assessed for by testing the effects of a variation in the number of control variables within the simulation.}

abstract = {The close integration of increasing operating units into an integrated energy system (IES) results in complex interconnections between these units. The strong dynamic interactions create barriers to designing a successful distributed coordinated controller to achieve synergy between all the units and unlock the potential for grid response. To address these challenges, we introduce a directed graph representation of IESs using an augmented Jacobian matrix to depict their underlying dynamics topology. By utilizing this representation, a generic subsystem decomposition method is proposed to partition the entire IES vertically based on the dynamic time scale and horizontally based on the closeness of interconnections between the operating units. Exploiting the decomposed subsystems, we develop a cooperative distributed economic model predictive control (DEMPC) with multiple global objectives that regulate the generated power at the grid’s requests and satisfy the customers cooling and system economic requirements. In the DEMPC, multiple local decision-making agents cooperate sequentially and iteratively to leverage the potential across all the units for system-wide dynamic synergy. Furthermore, we discuss how subsystem decomposition impacts the design of distributed cooperation schemes for IESs and provide a control-oriented basic guideline on the optimal decomposition of complex energy systems. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the control strategies with different levels of decomposition and collaboration will lead to marked differences in the overall performance of the IES. The standard control scheme based on the proposed subsystem configuration outperforms the empirical decomposition-based control benchmark by about 20%. The DEMPC architecture further improves the overall performance of the IES by about 55% compared to the benchmark.}

However, the optimized demand response probably cannot be achieved and energy demands probably cannot be fully satisfied in operation due to the large discrepancy between the predicted and actual conditions. Generic and comprehensive optimal control methods of building energy systems for demand response, which can achieve maximized benefits while ensuring satisfaction of actual energy demands, are still absent. In this study, a two-time-scale coordinated optimal control strategy is proposed to optimize energy dispatch between building energy systems for demand response considering forecast uncertainties. The control strategy includes two coordinated schemes: a stochastic scheduling scheme and a real-time optimal control scheme. Forecast uncertainties are quantified based on real meteorological data. The optimal start time of scheduling optimization horizon is investigated. The control strategy was tested on a platform with PV and battery, established based on the Zero Carbon Building in Hong Kong. Results show that the optimal scheduling optimization horizon start time is the initial of the off-peak period. The proposed strategy reduces up to 14.7% cost compared with existing strategies while satisfying actual energy demands.}

abstract = {As a promising technology for replacing the rule-based decision-making in region heating systems (RHS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a practical solution to identify the optimal control for heating equipment. However, as residential customers perform more casual energy-consumption behaviors, the intermittency and volatility of heat demands make managing heat supply and storage much harder for DRL agents. This study proposes a novel predictive management method for campus heating systems (CHS) with air-source heat pumps (AHP) and thermostatic water tanks. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the combination of the heat demands forecasting model and DRL-based adaptively controlling for heat supply equipment, which is firstly proposed to improve the heating supply reliability and reduce the storage dependence for CHS. Specifically, an enhanced rule, namely minimum length hamming encoding, and an input array constructing method is introduced to deal with discrete feature data and then improve the accuracy of deterministic heat demands forecasting based on long-short term memory (LSTM), and the Kernel density estimation (KDE) are employed to obtain the prediction intervals (PIs) from H-step ahead heat demands forecasting series. Followed by these, the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient, a model-free DRL control algorithm, is adopted for adaptively adjusting the output flow rate of AHP and then the storage of the hot water tank. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, a case study is presented where a campus heat demands forecasting achieves a maximum accuracy gain of 4.52%, and an optimal AHP operating controlling determined from PIs achieves a better cost reduction and supply reliability, which is superior over the conventional method using real-time heat demands or deterministic forecasting results as input.}

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) generation can drop sharply under reductions in solar irradiance due to cloud cover, resulting in adverse impacts on the performance of stand-alone microgrids. In addition, due to the stochastic nature of solar irradiance, it has remained challenging to forecast PV generation accurately. Therefore, a sufficient amount of operating reserve must be allocated for the variability and uncertainty of PV generation. However, excess operating reserve can decrease the economic efficiency of microgrids. This paper proposes an optimal generation scheduling and operating reserve management scheme for stand-alone PV-integrated microgrids, which comprises three core models. First, a two-stage recurrent neural network-based model is proposed for solar irradiance and cloud cover forecasting. Second, the operating reserve required for PV is managed more effectively based on weather conditions. Finally, an optimal generation scheduling model is applied based on the forecasting and operating reserve management models. The proposed scheme is applied to representative case studies to validate its advantages. The forecasting accuracy of the proposed model outperforms a conventional model. Under clear-sky conditions, the operating reserve for PV can be reduced down to 30% of PV output. Subsequently, the optimal operation scheduled by the proposed scheme can produce substantial savings of more than 5.5%.}

However, the uncertainties in load fluctuation and renewable energy will hinder the implementation of planning schemes, resulting in scheduling plans mismatching the actual demand, and ultimately failing to ensure the economic operation of microgrids. Therefore, the two-stage robust optimal scheduling framework that combines energy recovery, demand response, and forecast is proposed for scheduling in microgrids. Uncertainties and economic costs are fully considered in the framework to make the planning scheme for microgrids more in line with the actual project. Simulation consequences indicate that the BP neural network could efficiently forecast the load with an error within 5%. Additionally, considering thermodynamics and economy, 0.3 is the optimal split ratio for recompression supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle to recover waste heat from the gas turbine. Finally, Case 4 with energy recovery and demand response is economically optimal, with an annual operating cost of $1.71 million lower than the original Case 1 and a total annual cost 13.92% lower than Case 1. By comparing different cases, it is proved that the proposed Case 4 optimization framework has advantages for scheduling in microgrids.}
