	abstract = {The usage and adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) have increased rapidly in the 21st century due to the shifting of the global energy demand away from fossil fuels. The market penetration of EVs brings new challenges to the usual operations of the power system. Uncontrolled EV charging impacts the local distribution grid in terms of its voltage profile, power loss, grid unbalance, and reduction of transformer life, as well as harmonic distortion. Multiple research studies have addressed these problems by proposing various EV charging control methods. This manuscript comprehensively reviews EV control charging strategies using real-world data. This review classifies the EV control charging strategies into scheduling, clustering, and forecasting strategies. The models of EV control charging strategies are highlighted to compare and evaluate the techniques used in EV charging, enabling the identification of the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods applied. A summary of the methods and techniques for these EV charging strategies is presented based on machine learning and probabilities approaches. This research paper indicates many factors and challenges in the development of EV charging control in next-generation smart grid applications and provides potential recommendations. A report on the guidelines for future studies on this research topic is provided to enhance the comparability of the various results and findings. Accordingly, all the highlighted insights of this paper serve to further the increasing effort towards the development of advanced EV charging methods and demand-side management (DSM) for future smart grid applications.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and excessive fuel consumption have become a pressing issue nowadays. Particularly, CO2 emissions from transportation account for approximately one-quarter of global emissions since 2016. Electric vehicle (EV) is considered an appealing option to address the aforementioned concerns. However, with the growing EV market, issues such as insufficient charging infrastructure to support such ever-increasing demand emerge as well. Effectively forecasting the commercial EV charging demand ensures the reliability and robustness of grid utility in the short term and helps with investment planning and resource allocation for charging infrastructures in the long run. To this end, this article presents a time-series forecasting of the monthly commercial EV charging demand using a deep learning approach-Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq). The proposed model is validated by real-world datasets from the State of Utah and the City of Los Angeles. Two prediction targets, namely one-step ahead prediction and multi-step ahead prediction, are tested. Further, the model is benchmarked and compared against other time series and machine learning models. Experiments show that both Seq2seq and long short-term memory (LSTM) generate satisfactory prediction performance for one-step prediction. However, when performing the multi-step prediction, Seq2Seq significantly outperforms other models in terms of various performance metrics, indicating the model’s strong capability for sequential data predictions.},

If controlled properly, large PEV populations can enable high penetration of renewables by balancing loads with intermittent generation. The algorithmic challenges include scalability, computation, uncertainty, and constraints on driver mobility and power-system congestion. This paper addresses computation and communication challenges via a scalable distributed optimal charging algorithm. Specifically, we exploit the mathematical structure of the aggregated charging problem to distribute the optimization program, using duality theory. Explicit bounds of convergence are derived to guide computational requirements. Two variations in the dual-splitting algorithm are also presented, which enable privacy-preserving properties. Constraints on both individual mobility requirements and power-system capacity are also incorporated. We demonstrate the proposed dual-splitting framework on a load-shaping case study for the so-called California “Duck Curve” with mobility data generated from the vehicle-to-grid simulator.},

Suitably, a vast body of literature has been produced exploring various facets of EVs and their role in transportation and energy systems. This paper provides a timely and comprehensive review of scientific studies looking at various aspects of EVs, including: (a) an overview of the status of the light-duty-EV market and current projections for future adoption; (b) insights on market opportunities beyond light-duty EVs; (c) a review of cost and performance evolution for batteries, power electronics, and electric machines that are key components of EV success; (d) charging-infrastructure status with a focus on modeling and studies that are used to project charging-infrastructure requirements and the economics of public charging; (e) an overview of the impact of EV charging on power systems at multiple scales, ranging from bulk power systems to distribution networks; (f) insights into life-cycle cost and emissions studies focusing on EVs; and (g) future expectations and synergies between EVs and other emerging trends and technologies. The goal of this paper is to provide readers with a snapshot of the current state of the art and help navigate this vast literature by comparing studies critically and comprehensively and synthesizing general insights. This detailed review paints a positive picture for the future of EVs for on-road transportation, and the authors remain hopeful that remaining technology, regulatory, societal, behavioral, and business-model barriers can be addressed over time to support a transition toward cleaner, more efficient, and affordable transportation solutions for all.},

However, the station operation performance has become an increasingly important factor for enhancing charging service accessibility. In this work, we propose an innovative station-level optimization framework to operate charging station with optimal pricing policy and charge scheduling. This model incorporates human behaviors to explicitly and effectively capture drivers' charging decision process. We propose a menu of price-differentiated charging services, which differ in both the per-unit prices and the energy delivery schedule. Involving human in the loop, the operation model also exploits the capability to alleviate the overstay issue that occurs when a PEV's charging session has completed. We then propose a muli-block convex transformation methodology to reformulate the resulted non-convex problem via Fenchel-Young Inequality; the Block Coordinate Descent algorithm is applied to solve the overall problem and the efficiency enables real-time implementation. As a result, our simulation demonstrates that the proposed control polices can realize benefits in three aspects: (i) net profits gains, (ii) overstay reduction, and (iii) quality-of-service increase.},

For the EV charging stations (EVCSs), it is often difficult to conduct effective operations due to the incomplete information in EVs’ departure times and the opacity of their preference information. To tackle this challenge, we seek to design the optimal deadline differentiated dynamic price menu that offers multiple choice-pairs of deadlines and charging prices. We prove that such price menus can incentivize EVs to truthfully reveal their departure time. We then analyze the properties of the optimal price menu with complete EV information, i.e., social optimality and first-degree price discrimination. For the incomplete information case, we first design a systematic method to estimate the utility and demand information for a large population of EVs based on EV behavior data. Then, we employ mixed-integer quadratic programming for the efficient optimal price menu design. The numerical study based on field data in California verifies the remarkable performance of our designed price menu.},

	abstract = {This article studies optimal plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging station planning, with consideration for the “overstay” problem. Today, public PEV charging station utilization is typically around 15\%. When un-utilized, the chargers are either idle or occupied by a fully charged PEV that has not departed. We call this “overstay.” This motivates a strategy for increasing utilization by interchanging fully charged PEVs with those waiting for service-an issue which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Thus, this article studies the PEV charging station planning problem taking strategic interchange into account. To our best understanding, this has not been studied in the literature. With interchange, the objective is to enhance the charger utilization rate and, thus, reduce the number of chargers. This potentially reduces the capital investment and operational cost. A novel power/energy aggregation model is proposed, and a chance-constrained stochastic programming planning model with interchange is developed for a public charging station to incorporate customer demand uncertainties. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that incorporating strategic interchange operation can significantly decrease the number of chargers, enhance utilization and economic efficiency.},

	abstract = {With the increase in adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), proper utilization of the charging infrastructure is an emerging challenge for service providers. Overstaying of an EV after a charging event is a key contributor to low utilization. Since overstaying is easily detectable by monitoring the power drawn from the charger, managing this problem primarily involves designing an appropriate "penalty" during the overstaying period. Higher penalties do discourage overstaying; however, due to uncertainty in parking duration, less people would find such penalties acceptable, leading to decreased utilization (and revenue). To analyze this central tradeoff, we develop a novel framework that integrates models for realistic user behavior into queueing dynamics to locate the optimal penalty from the points of view of utilization and revenue, for different values of the external charging demand. Next, when the model parameters are unknown, we show how an online learning algorithm, such as UCB, can be adapted to learn the optimal penalty. Our experimental validation, based on charging data from London, shows that an appropriate penalty can increase both utilization and revenue while significantly reducing overstaying.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates strategies to increase charging station utilization, reduce congestion, and increase access to chargers at workplaces. Interviews with plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) drivers across California revealed three styles of workplace charging management: authoritative (rules introduced by the employer), collective (rules introduced by employees), and unmanaged (no rules in place). Authoritative charging included digital queuing, time limits with pricing, pricing, and valet charging. Collective management included day restrictions, time restrictions, messaging groups, and spreadsheets with driver information. Charging management strategies can increase accessibility and utilization of stations by reducing congestion, increasing vehicle throughput and discouraging those that do not need to charge from doing so. Workplaces with charging management may need less charging infrastructure to support more PEVs. Interviewees reported positive experiences with the charging management strategies at their workplaces. Charging management strategies appear to be a user-friendly approach to reducing charge point congestion, vehicles overstaying, and increase utilization of workplace charging.},

	abstract = {Many city residents cannot install their private electric vehicle (EV) chargers due to the lack of dedicated parking spaces or insufficient grid capacity. This presents a significant barrier towards large-scale EV adoption. To address this concern, this paper considers a novel business model, on-demand valet charging, that unlocks the potential of under-utilized public charging infrastructure to promise higher EV penetration. In the proposed model, a platform recruits a fleet of couriers that shuttle between customers and public charging stations to provide on-demand valet charging services to EV owners at an affordable price. Couriers are dispatched to pick up low-battery EVs from customers, deliver the EVs to charging stations, plug them in, and then return the fully-charged EVs to customers. To depict the proposed business model, we develop a queuing network to represent the stochastic matching dynamics, and further formulate an economic equilibrium model to capture the incentives of couriers, customers as well as the platform. These models are used to examine how charging infrastructure planning and regulatory intervention will affect the market outcome. First, we find that the optimal charging station densities for distinct stakeholders are different: couriers prefer a lower density; the platform prefers a higher density; while the density in-between leads to the highest EV penetration as it balances the time traveling to and queuing at charging stations. Second, we evaluate a regulatory policy that imposes a tax on the platform and invests the tax revenue in public charging infrastructure. Numerical results suggest that this regulation can suppress the platform’s market power associated with monopoly pricing, increase social welfare, and facilitate the market expansion.},

	abstract = {This article aims to design an intelligent mobile charging control mechanism for electric vehicles (EVs), by promoting charging reservations (including service start time, expected charging time, and charging location). EV mobile charging could be implemented as an alternative recharging solution, wherein charge replenishment is provided by economically mobile plug-in chargers, capable of providing on-site charging services. With intelligent charging management, readily available mobile chargers are predictable and could be efficiently scheduled toward EVs with charging demand, based on updated context collected from across the charging network. The context can include critical information relating to charging sessions and charging demand. Furthermore, with reservations introduced, accurate estimations on charging demand for a future moment are achievable, and correspondingly, optimal mobile chargers selection can be obtained. Therefore, charging demands across the network can be efficiently and effectively satisfied, with the support of intelligent system-level decisions. In order to evaluate critical performance attributes, we further carry out extensive simulation experiments with practical concerns to verify our insights observed from the theoretical analysis. Results show great performance gains by promoting the reservation-based mobile charger selection, especially for mobile chargers equipped with suffice power capacity. Note to Practitioners-The convenience of charging service is one major concern for EVs, especially when an urgent charging is required while none charging points are reachable. Recently, a Chinese EV company (NIO, Inc., Shanghai, China) is promoting its mobile charger (ES8 model) to Tesla. Driven by such market trend, this article proposes an efficient approach toward intelligent scheduling of mobile chargers toward parked EVs. Different from fixed charging stations focusing on the problem of long waiting times, the proposed solution is applicable to charging-on-demand with precharging appointment at mobile chargers. Preliminary experiments show great charging efficiency achieved by concerning the issue of where to reserve, i.e., the consideration of optimal selection on mobile chargers. Such mobile charging services can coexist with the governmental or pilots' initiated charging station deployment. However, future research will need to evaluate the holistic service platform.},

	abstract = {Range anxiety has been the main challenge for the mass-adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The emerging mobile electric-vehicle-to-electric-vehicle (mE2) charging technology, which allows an EV with the extra battery to charge the other EV on the move, offers a promising solution. Even though the physical feasibility of this new technology has been confirmed, we still face many operation problems. For example, how can we efficiently pair and route an electricity provider (EP) to a demand (ED) without introducing an extra detour? Motivated by this view, this study develops a Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform, which seeks to dispatches the commercial EPs to serve the EDs, for cultivating this emerging charging service towards the low EV penetration environment. Mathematically, the CaaS platform is modeled as a vehicle routing problem (i.e., mE2-VRP), which optimally dispatches the EPs to approach and serve the EDs on the move while minimizing the EP fleet size and fulfilling all service requests. To adapt the CaaS platform to the online application in practice, we develop the Clustering-aided Clarke and Wright Savings (CCWS) algorithm to efficiently decompose and then solve the large-scale mE2-VRP by parallel computing. Our numerical experiments built upon citywide (Chicago) and statewide (Florida) found that the CCWS algorithm outperforms existing commercial solvers, and it enables us to investigate the performance of the CaaS platform under a realistic large-scale setup in a city or state. The CaaS performs better in low EV penetration markets while traffic congestion is mild and EDs require energy earlier. We can improve the performance by developing proper pricing strategies according to the EDs' energy requests and trip lengths.},

This is an alternate system in which the charge replenishment is provided by mobile chargers (MCs). These chargers could have two possible configurations: a mobile plug-in charger (MP) or a mobile battery-swapping station (MS). A queuing-based analytical approach is used to determine the appropriate range of design parameters for such a mobile charging system. An analytical analysis is first developed for an idealized system with a nearest-job-next (NJN) service strategy explored for such a system. In a NJN service strategy, the MC services the next spatially closest EV when it is finished with its current request. An urban environment approximated by Singapore is then analyzed through simulation. Charging requests are simulated through a trip generation model based on Singapore. In such a realistic environment, an updated practical NJN service strategy is proposed. For an MP system in an urban environment such as Singapore, there exists an optimal battery capacity with a threshold battery charge rate. Similarly, the battery swap capacity of an MS system does not need to be large for the system to perform.},

	abstract = {Battery electric buses (BEBs) are considered a promising alternative for bus fleets to alleviate the growing environmental problems in urban areas, and fast-charging technology has been introduced to BEB systems to help electric buses provide uninterrupted service without the need to carry a large onboard battery. The general consensus is that fast-charging may lead to high electricity demand charges, thus compromising the competitiveness of electric bus systems. However, a majority of current electric bus fast-charging station deployment models ignore these charges. The present study addresses this gap by explicitly considering the electricity demand charges in the optimal deployment problem of fast-charging stations for battery electric bus systems. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing the total cost of vehicle batteries, fast-charging stations, energy storage systems, and electricity demand charges. Numerical studies based on a real-world bus network in Salt Lake City, Utah, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can effectively determine the deployment of fast-charging stations, the design of vehicle battery sizes, as well as the installation of energy storage systems. This study demonstrates that energy storage systems are a potential remedy for high demand charges from fast-charging.},

The proposed charging scheme implements a real-time water-filling algorithm able to reduce the peak demand and to prioritize EV charging based on the data of plugged-in EVs. The algorithm also accommodates utility and local demand response and load control signals for extensive peak shaving. Real-world EV charging data from different types of venues are used to develop and evaluate the smart charging scheme for demand charge reduction at medium \& large general service locations.

This problem is challenging because a facility with a larger charging capacity (hence better service quality) can be more expensive to build and operate. This paper contributes to the literature by planning an EV charging facility that overcomes this trade-off and achieves Pareto optimality, i.e. a facility with a higher quality of service but at a lower cost. We propose an optimization model to size an EV charging facility that minimizes the facility cost and guarantees a high quality of service. To reduce the cost further and negate the cost increase from quality service quality, we adopt demand management strategies. Two strategies are explored, namely Stationary Demand Management (a local energy storage system) and Mobile Demand Management (rescheduling charging sessions of EVs). The proposed model produces a facility that guarantees a high quality of service in charging EVs at a minimal cost. A facility with demand management strategies achieves a higher service quality but at a lower cost, compared to a facility without demand management strategies. Stationary Demand Management can reduce the cost similarly to Mobile Demand Management, while the latter can be more challenging in practice due to the compliance issues and demand uncertainty of the drivers.},

While current literature provides charging choices and categorizations of charging behavior, these seem oversimplified and limitedly based on charging data. In this research we provide a typology of charging behavior and electric vehicle user types based on 4.9 million charging transactions from January 2017 until March 2019 and 27,000 users on 7079 Charging Points the public level 2 charging infrastructure of 4 largest cities and metropolitan areas of the Netherlands. We overcome predefined stereotypical expectations of user behavior by using a bottom-up data driven two-step clustering approach that first clusters charging sessions and thereafter portfolios of charging sessions per user. From the first clustering (Gaussian Mixture) 13 distinct charging session types were found; 7 types of daytime charging sessions (4 short, 3 medium duration) and 6 types of overnight charging sessions. The second clustering (Partition Around Medoids) clustering result in 9 user types based on their distinct portfolio of charging session types. We found (i) 3 daytime office hours charging user types (ii) 3 overnight user types and (iii) 3 non-typical user types (mixed day and overnight chargers, visitors and car sharing). Three user types show significant peaks at larger battery sizes which affects the time between sessions. Results show that none of the user types display solely stereotypical behavior as the range of behaviors is more varied and more subtle. Analysis of population composition over time revealed that large battery users increase over time in the population. From this we expect that shifts charging portfolios will be observed in future, while the types of charging remain stable.},

This roll out, however, poses challenges to power systems, as additional power demand is injected in context of increasingly volatile supply from renewable energy sources. Smart EV charging services can provide a solution to such challenges. The development of effective smart charging services requires evaluating pre-emptively EV drivers’ response. The current practice in the appraisal of smart charging strategies largely relies on simplistic or theoretical representation of drivers’ charging and travel behaviour. We propose a random utility model for joint EV drivers’ activity-travel scheduling and charging choices. Our model easily integrates in activity-based demand modelling systems for the analyses of integrated transport and energy systems. However, unlike previous charging behaviour models used in integrated transport and energy system analyses, our model empirically captures the behavioural nuances of tactical charging choices in smart grid context, using empirically estimated charging preferences. We present model estimation results that provide insights into the value placed by individuals on the main attributes of the charging choice and draw implications charging service providers.},

Battery swapping stations are poised as effective means of eliminating the long waiting times associated with charging the EV batteries. These stations are mediators between the power system and their customers.

This paper proposes an optimization framework for the operating model of battery swapping stations. The proposed model considers the day-ahead scheduling process. Battery demand uncertainty is modeled using inventory robust optimization, while multi-band robust optimization is employed to model electricity price uncertainty.

	abstract = {Lack of charging facilities is still a significant barrier to the electrification of the logistic system. How to effectively schedule the electric vehicle (EV) charging power to reduce the charging station operating cost when the number of chargers was limited becomes an important issue. To tackle this issue, an optimal charging scheduling method by responding to the time-of-used (TOU) electricity price is proposed. First, the uncontrolled charging model to fully charge EVs as fast as possible is established. Then, an optimal charging scheduling model by considering the limited number of chargers is proposed to both reduce the charging cost and guarantee the charging demand of each EVs. The proposed model is formulated as a bilevel programming (BP) model. The charger index and available charging duration for each EV are determined at the upper level, while the charging power of each EV at each time slot is determined at the lower level. After that, a solving approach is introduced for the proposed BP model. The efficacy and performance of the proposed charging scheduling method are verified by simulation results.},

However, the most of existing research works consider EV charging station assignment and navigation services in the TN separately from charging station power scheduling services in the DN. To overcome this research gap, this paper proposes a collaborative optimal routing and scheduling (CORS) method, providing optimal route to charging stations and designing optimized charging scheduling schemes for each EV. In the order of reporting, whenever an EV reports its charging demand, a CORS optimization model is built and solved so that a specific charging scheme is designed for that EV. Then, the TN and DN status is updated to guide the subsequent EVs operating. The proposed CORS integrates the real-time state of the TN and DN, and effects positive benefits in helping EVs to avoid traffic congestion, improving the utilization level of charging facilities and enhancing charging economy. The combined distributed biased min consensus algorithm and generalized benders decomposition algorithm are adopted to solve the complex nonlinear optimization problem. Through comparing with the existing methods, better effectiveness is verified by simulation results.},

In these circumstances, it has become a key factor for the development of micro-grid to realize efficient and economical operation of smart micro-grid considering Demand Response strategy. In this paper, an intelligent park micro-grid consisting of photovoltaic power generation, combined cooling heating and power system, energy storage system and response load is modeled to study the optimal scheduling strategy of these units by taking into account the price-based demand response. To achieve this goal, an optimization model for the economic operation of micro-grid is established, and the model presented mainly aims to minimize the operating cost of micro-grid system and make full use of clean energy under the premise of considering distributed power generation and demand response. This operation optimization problem is solved by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the best solution on the best operating strategy is determined by the clean energy resources and demand response program. Finally, a micro-grid project in China was used to carry out optimization simulation in order to verify the accuracy and reliability of the established model. It is found that the operation optimization model of micro-grid with demand response can effectively reduce the operation cost of and improve the utilization rate of renewable energy sources.},

A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for planning a public parking lot charging station equipped with SOMC spots. The first stage of the programming model is planning of SOMC spots and its objective is to obtain an optimal configuration of the charging station to minimize the station’s equivalent annual costs, including investment and operation costs. The second stage of the programming model involves a probabilistic simulation procedure, in which coordinated charging is simulated, so that the influence of coordinated charging on the planning is considered. A case study of a residential parking lot charging station verifies the effectiveness of the proposed planning model.

Based on a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) clustering algorithm, a location determination model was developed to obtain the specific locations for EV charging stations with their service EV clusters. A capacity determination model based on the queuing theory was proposed to determine the capacity of each EV charging station. The round-island freeway in Hainan Island of China was employed as a test system to illustrate the planning method.

	abstract = {Today, charging electric vehicles (EVs) from the utility grid has resulted in high electricity costs besides enhanced emissions. On the other hand, increased renewable energy penetration has caused curtailing a considerable share of the produced energy. This paper aims at bridging the gap between these challenges utilizing mobile charging stations (MCS). Integrated with battery energy storage, the MCS shifts the curtailed renewable energy spatially and temporally for EV charging. To this end, a novel model is proposed for joint MCS spatio-temporal status and battery power-energy scheduling in the presence of fixed charging stations (FCSs). Besides, a new paradigm is introduced for EV charging management and queuing in both MCS and FCS. The excess curtailed renewable energy is stored in the MCS battery for EV charging later and at a different location. The numerical testing of the model denotes a 9.63\% reduction in the daily operation cost. Besides, wind and solar energy curtailment are reduced by 15.60\% and 54.60\%, respectively. Additionally, the EV charging queue represents a 90\% reduction while FCS empty sockets increase by 80\%. The benefits for the grid include peak shaving, improved voltages, and increased renewable penetration.},

Therefore, the cost drivers for both BEV owners and charging station providers are analyzed. In addition, key infrastructure considerations are examined, including grid stability and delivery of power, the design of fast charging stations and the design and use of electric vehicle service equipment. Each of these aspects have technical barriers that need to be addressed, and are directly linked to economic impacts to use and implementation. This discussion focuses on both the economic and infrastructure issues which exist and need to be addressed for the effective implementation of fast charging at 400kW and above. In so doing, it has been found that there is a distinct need to effectively manage the intermittent, high power demand of fast charging, strategically plan infrastructure corridors, and to further understand the cost of operation of charging infrastructure and BEVs.},

	abstract = {A large fraction of total electricity demand is comprised of end-use devices whose demand for energy is inherently deferrable in time. Of interest is the potential to use this latent flexibility in demand to absorb variability in power supplied from intermittent renewable generation. A fundamental challenge lies in the design of incentives that induce the desired response in demand. With an eye to electric vehicle charging, we propose a novel forward market for deadline-differentiated electric power service, where consumers consent to deferred service of prespecified loads in exchange for a reduced price for energy. The longer a consumer is willing to defer, the lower the price for energy. The proposed forward contract provides a guarantee on the aggregate quantity of energy to be delivered by a consumer-specified deadline. Under the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling policy, which is shown to be optimal for the supplier, we explicitly characterize a non-discriminatory, deadline-differentiated pricing scheme that yields an efficient competitive equilibrium between the supplier and consumers. We further show that this efficient pricing scheme, in combination with EDF scheduling, is incentive compatible in that every consumer would like to reveal her true deadline to the supplier, regardless of the actions taken by other consumers.},

The EVs can inject energy by discharging via a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service, which can enhance the profits of the charging station. However, frequent charging and discharging degrade battery life. We propose a menu-based pricing scheme, where the charging station selects a price for each arriving user (EV owner) for the amount of battery utilization, the total energy, and the time (deadline) that the EV will stay. The user can accept one of the menus or rejects all. The user reaches its decision based on the utilities. The charging utilizes its own limited renewable energy, and the conventional energy bought from the grid to serve the users. We show that there exists a prior-free pricing mechanism, which maximizes the ex-post social welfare for a myopic scenario. It selects a lower price for the menu containing a higher V2G service. However, the prior free pricing mechanism does not necessarily maximizes the expected profit. We show that the pricing strategy, which sets the price for a menu at a fixed value greater than the marginal cost of serving the menu, maximizes the expected profit for a wide class of utility functions. In the menu-based pricing, when the harvested renewable energy is small the users have higher incentives for the V2G service. We, numerically, show that the charging station's profit and the user's surplus both increase as V2G service is efficiently utilized by the pricing mechanism.},

Successful market penetration of V2G relies not only on developing the technology itself, but also on EV drivers' willingness to participate in this technology. This paper aims to explore Dutch EV drivers' preferences for participating in V2G contracts. In particular, we conduct a context-dependent stated choice experiment to examine the impact of EV recharging technology on the V2G contract preferences. Two contexts have been designed: the current EV recharging time and fast recharging. Our results show that in the context of current recharging time, Dutch EV drivers in general prefer not to participate in V2G contracts, while the opposite is true in the context of fast recharging. With regard to specific V2G contract attributes, Dutch EV drivers are most concerned about ‘discharging cycles’. Also important to them is ‘the guaranteed minimum battery level’, but its importance drops significantly in the fast charging context. In addition, ‘monthly remuneration’ and ‘plug-in time’ also influence people's preferences for adopting V2G. From these findings, we draw the implications for the aggregator and policy makers.},

However, since electricity generation involves using fossil fuels, it is not established where and when the replacement of fossil-fuel-based technologies by electric cars and heat pumps can effectively reduce overall emissions. Could electrification policies backfire by promoting their diffusion before electricity is decarbonized? Here we analyse current and future emissions trade-offs in 59 world regions with heterogeneous households, by combining forward-looking integrated assessment model simulations with bottom-up life-cycle assessments. We show that already under current carbon intensities of electricity generation, electric cars and heat pumps are less emission intensive than fossil-fuel-based alternatives in 53 world regions, representing 95\% of the global transport and heating demand. Even if future end-use electrification is not matched by rapid power-sector decarbonization, it will probably reduce emissions in almost all world regions.},

	abstract = {Distribution of limited smart grid resources among electric vehicles (EVs) with diverse service demands in an unfavorable manner can potentially degrade the overall profit achievable by the operating charging station (CS). In fact, inefficient resource management can lead to customer dissatisfaction arising due to prolonged queueing and blockage of EVs arriving at the CS for service. In this paper, a dynamic electric power allocation scheme for a charging facility is proposed and modeled as a bi-variate continuous-time Markovian process, with exclusive charging outlets being allotted to EVs of different classes in real-time. The presented mechanism enables the CS to guarantee the quality-of-service expected by customers in terms of blocking probability, while also maximizing its own overall revenue. By adopting a practical congestion pricing model within the defined profit function, the revenue optimization framework for a single CS is further extended to a load-balanced network of CSs. Simulation results for the single CS and networked models reveal considerably higher satisfaction levels for congested fast charging EV customers and improved attainable system revenue as compared to a baseline scenario which assumes no classification based on EV service preferences.},

The cluster stores energy in hydrogen as the seasonal storage medium and chilled water for cooling as the daily storage medium. Thermal storage of chilled water and the use of efficient air-conditioning (refrigeration) equipment significantly reduces the needs for the generated electric energy and stored energy: The utilization of thermal storage in addition to chemical storage has three beneficial results: a) it reduces by about 40% the needed solar power installation; b) it reduces by a factor of three the losses associated with energy storage; and c) it reduces by factor of four the necessary hydrogen storage capacity. The improved performance of the system is expected to significantly reduce the overall cost associated with grid independent buildings.}

A microgrid is considered for exemplification, connected to an external grid via a transformer and containing a local consumer, a renewable generator (wind turbine) and a storage facility (battery). Optimal scheduling of battery is sought for minimizing costs. To this aim, a predictive control framework is proposed, which allows taking into consideration cost values, power consumption and generation profiles, and specific constraints. Uncertainty due to variations in the generator model parameters is taken into account. The efficiency of the proposed approach is validated through simulation results and comparisons using real numerical data for a test system often considered in bulk power system reliability evaluation studies. The obtained results show that predictive control is a viable approach for providing optimal energy management solutions accounting for costs, profiles and constraints.}

In particular, the instability of the power system is intensifying due to the duck curve phenomenon (the net load between sunrise and sunset decreases rapidly and the demand for power increases for about 3h after sunset). Therefore, this paper presents the ESS integrated gas turbine (EIGT) system, which is an integrated system of energy storage system (ESS) using micro gas turbine (MGT) and reused battery. This research contributes to verifying the utility of reused battery and compensating a duck curve through operation in a system that integrates an energy storage system using micro gas turbine and reused battery, which are small power sources that can be operated independently of the existing renewable energy. According to the result of this research, the state of health (SOH), state of charge (SOC), internal resistance, temperature, and heating rate of the reused battery were verified by supplying power, which is increased by about 66% after sunset in a duck curve phenomenon. Accordingly, it may contribute to stabilizing the power system in the duck curve phenomenon.}

Analyzing the effect due to these disturbances on power system network is an important feature of this work. This paper proposes a control algorithm that focuses on sophisticated fuzzy logic approach. Advanced fuzzy control takes overloading and variation in demand profile as input, which mitigate these disturbances by incorporating optimal power dispatch of renewable energy resources (RERs). To show the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model and fuzzy control design, 9 Bus test system of the transmission network is adopted. Not only normal mode but fault and overloading modes are used to verify the proposed approach. Competitiveness of the proposed control design in terms of reliability and optimal utilization of RERs are verified through simulation results.}

In microgrid, an energy management system is essential for optimal use of these distributed energy resources in intelligent, secure, reliable, and coordinated ways. Therefore, this review paper presents a comparative and critical analysis on decision making strategies and their solution methods for microgrid energy management systems. To manage the volatility and intermittency of renewable energy resources and load demand, various uncertainty quantification methods are summarized.

abstract = {Microgrids can integrate variable renewable energy sources into the energy system by controlling flexible assets locally. However, as the energy system is dynamic, an effective microgrid controller must be able to receive feedback from the system in real-time, plan ahead and take into account the active electricity tariff, to maximize the benefits to the operator. These requirements motivate the use of optimization-based control methods, such as Model Predictive Control to optimally dispatch flexible assets in microgrids. However, the major bottleneck to achieve maximum benefits with these methods is their predictive accuracy. This paper addresses this bottleneck by developing a novel multi-step forecasting method for a Model Predictive Control framework. The presented methods are applied to a real test-bed of a renewable energy community in Austria, where its operational costs and CO2 emissions are benchmarked with those of a rule-based control strategy for Flat, Time-of-Use, Demand Charge and variable energy price tariffs. In addition, the impact of forecast errors and electric battery capacity on energy community operational savings are examined. The key results indicate that the proposed controller can outperform a rule-based dispatch strategy by 24.7\% in operational costs and by 8.4\% in CO2 emissions through optimal operation of flexibilities if it has perfect foresight. However, if the controller is deployed in a realistic environment, where forecasts for electrical load and PV generation are required, the same savings are reduced to 3.3\% for cost and 7.3\% for CO2, respectively. In such environments, the proposed controller performs best in highly dynamic tariffs such as Time-of-Use and Real-time pricing rates, achieving real cost savings of up to 6.3\%. These results show that the profitability of optimization-based control of microgrids is threatened by forecast errors. This motivates future research on control strategies that compensate for forecast errors in real-world operation and more accurate forecasting methods.}

Unlocking these benefits requires designing suitable business models that can capture the value of MGs and that help removing barriers to their uptake. In this work, we evaluate the profitability and self-sufficiency of optimally designed MGs for new proposed business models. The business models are tested in seventeen different geographical locations which offer a vast diversity of renewable resources, seasonal climatic variability and electricity tariffs. Both Net Billing and Net Metering schemes are tested, for both single-dwelling and community residential customers. Electricity tariffs include both energy volumetric and peak demand charges. We model the optimal sizing and energy management of the MGs by minimizing the total customer electricity costs. The generation mix of the MGs is the result of a bilevel optimization which take into account renewable resources and costs, diesel prices and tariffs. MGs can potentially be comprised by solar PV, wind and diesel generation, together with battery storage systems and demand response resources. We find significant levels of self-sufficiency based on solar sources across the country, and also wind power in some specific locations. The community business model, case which includes the peak demand charges, is generally more profitable than the case of single-dwellings. This shows that the MGs are effective at reducing the peak demand charge of a residential electricity bill. We therefore recommend the further promotion of community energy arrangements as a key way to improve the current very slow uptake of distributed generation in developing countries.}

The microgrid includes a hydrogen energy system consisting of an alkaline electrolyzer, hydrogen cylinder bundles and a fuel cell for energy storage. Local generation is provided from photovoltaic panels, and the load is given by a fixed load profile combined with a flexible electrical load, which is a battery electric vehicle. The electrolyzer has ramp-up constraints which are modeled explicitly. The objective function includes, besides operational costs and an environmental indicator, a representation of peak power costs, thus leading to an overall peak load reduction under optimized operation. The model is used both for controlling a microgrid in a field trial set-up deployed in South-West Germany and for simulating the microgrid operation for defined period, thus allowing for economic system evaluation. Results from defined sample runs show that the energy storage is primarily used for trimming the peak of electricity drawn from the public grid and is not solely operated with excess power. The flexible demand operation also helps keeping the peak at its possible minimum.}

Based on a microgrid implementation in California, we investigate microgrid operation under real-world conditions. These conditions have not yet been considered in combination and encompass energy charges, demand charges, export limits, as well as uncertainty about future electricity demand and generation in the microgrid. Under these conditions, we evaluate the performance of two frequently applied groups of strategies for microgrid operation. The first group is composed of proactive strategies that optimize decisions based on forecasts of future electricity generation and demand. The second group includes reactive strategies that make operational decisions based exclusively on the current state of the microgrid. We evaluate the performance of the strategies under varying operational parameters, forecast accuracies, and microgrid configurations—well beyond our Californian showcase. Our results confirm the expectation that proactive strategies outperform reactive ones in the majority of settings. Yet, reactive strategies can perform better under short control intervals or under moderate prediction errors of PV generation or demand. Furthermore, the interplay between real-world conditions and operational strategies reveals several additional insights for research on microgrid operation. First, we find that demand charges and export limits decisively affect microgrid performance. Second, the impact of forecast errors is highly non-linear and non-monotonous. Third, escalating negative interactions between forecast errors and demand charges make proactive strategies benefit from longer control intervals. This result is contrary to existing best practice, which promotes short control intervals to minimize the impact of uncertainty.}

abstract = {Microgrid management is a multi-objective problem that involves purchasing and selling energy, time-variant renewable generation, and maintenance costs. The microgrid can operate autonomously on an island or through mode connected with the main grid. This paper proposes an original optimization model for the management of an isolated microgrid that allows the automatic grid connection to provide ancillary services to the main grid, such as selling the excess renewable generation and purchasing electricity to charge the battery bank. The proposed optimization is formulated via hybrid economic model predictive control using weather forecasts performed by a mesoscale meteorological model. It includes new constraints to meet a specific connection/disconnection regulation, such as the minimum connection/disconnection time and the maximum connection frequency. This paper also proposes a new hybrid model of a battery bank that includes the grid connection/ disconnection. Furthermore, the hybrid models of renewable energy sources convert weather data to the wind and photovoltaic power by using the mixed logical dynamical framework. The proposed algorithm is sensitive to the forecasting error, which causes variations of 1% in the met demand, 27.3% in the battery bank costs, and 13.3% in the financial profits. Compared to multi-period mixed integer linear programming and rule-based strategy, we show that the proposed controller manages the microgrid more safely (i.e., it provides state of charge below its critical value during a period less than 25% of that offered by other strategies). In locations with high energy generation, only the proposed optimization furnishes energy sale profit.}

abstract = {Hybrid Polygeneration Energy Systems (HPES) can be effective solutions to reach COP26 goals. In particular, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems can increase the total system efficiency when both electrical and thermal power are required. The integration of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) can further improve the plant efficiency and economy, assuring higher operational flexibility. Configuration, sizing and control strategy definition are of primary concern for these systems when the best possible performances are sought. This work aims to quantitatively assess the importance of the adopted control strategy in the operation and performance of a possible sub-system of a grid-connected Hybrid Polygeneration Energy Systems (HPES), consisting in this study of a CHP plant assisted by a BESS. A simulation code of the plant from an energetic point of view was used, and the main economic indicator was also calculated according to the legislative reference scenario. Then a Prescient Model Predictive Control (MPC) was coded to achieve near-optimal plant operation, using a novel system state description to reduce the computational burden linked to the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) solution. The BESS system was modelled, including cycle battery ageing. Subsequently, the performances of the adopted prescient MPC have been compared to the previous results given by a multi-objective plant sizing with a rule-based control. The results show that the control strategy can enhance the performance of the CHP system, achieving remarkable overall better performances, with up to 12% higher Primary Energy Savings. Moreover, the research findings highlight how the proposed control variable ensure a reduction of the computational time by more than 70%, also improving the quality of the found solutions to the OCP. The results also suggest that proper control strategies should be adopted even in a preliminary optimal sizing phase of the CHP plant, since there is a large room of improvement in predicting the achievable plant performance when more basic rule-based control strategies are overcome and replaced by MPC.}

These algorithms combine forecasts of site consumption, generation and electricity costs and a model of the battery system in a solver that minimises a cost objective over some forecast horizon. Often they are trialled in simulation environments without the complexities introduced by real-world deployments such data quality and reliability issues, communication issues and forecast inaccuracies to name a few. This study reports on a trial demonstration of a cloud-based data-driven robust model predictive battery control algorithm controlling an existing 150kWh lithium-ion battery at an operational site housing 100+ office staff. Forecasting model and control performance are evaluated in situ. Despite two of the four battery inverters being non-functional, the algorithm delivered electricity bill cost savings of 5.5%, of which two-thirds was the result of reducing the sites capacity charge from 358 kVa to 317 kVa. Throughout the trial multiple operational issues were encountered mostly related to data outages, equipment and communications reliability and the lessons learned from managing these occurrences are also discussed.}

abstract = {The optimal dispatch of the integrated power and natural gas systems can increase the utilization rate of renewable energy and energy efficiency while decreasing operation costs. The common prediction errors of wind power and electric load have the potential to negatively impact the normal operation of the integrated power and natural gas systems. A two-stage data-driven dispatch strategy is proposed to reduce this effect, consisting of the day-ahead dispatch stage and the intraday rolling dispatch stage using stochastic model predictive control (MPC). In the day-ahead dispatch stage, the data-driven chance constraints of tie-line power and reserve of gas-fired generators are built, and the day-ahead tie-line power is obtained and regarded as input parameters to the intraday dispatch stage. In the intraday dispatch stage, the data-driven chance constraints of tie-line power and reserve of gas-fired generators with the latest rolling prediction data are built, and the remaining control variables are obtained. The distribution characteristics of the stochastic prediction errors of wind power and electric load are captured and described by the variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with massive historical data. Then the original stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is converted to a tractable deterministic one by the quantile-based analytical reformulation and convex relaxation technique. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified by the numerical experiments based on a modified IEEE 33-bus system integrated with a 10-node natural gas system and a micro hydrogen system. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy reduces the actual costs and decreases the violation rate caused by the stochastic prediction errors of wind power and electric load.}

abstract = {The dynamic optimization of key setpoints (e.g., supply water temperatures of chillers and cooling towers, or indoor temperature and humidity) can track the efficient performance point of the air-conditioning system (ACS), thus obtaining a great energy-saving effect. The model predictive control is an effective way to precisely adjust these setpoints. However, most of the existing studies focused on simple linear strategies, e.g., experience-based, rule-based, or component-based, which results in unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Aiming at this, the paper proposed a novel machine learning-based model predictive control (MLB-MPC) framework with predictive inputs of disturbances. The framework first employed the grid search and cross-validation to optimize the total energy consumption prediction models (TECPMs), which were built by data-driven models (e.g., multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest). And then the optimization performances of each TECPM to the controlled variables were obtained by using different optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing). Finally, the optimal match of TECPMs and optimization algorithms was achieved by trade-off among prediction accuracies, optimization accuracies, and optimization time. The case studies demonstrated that the optimal match for the MLB-MPC is SVR and PSO as they had the highest prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error of 2.5%) and shortest optimization time (41ms/per) and optimization accuracies with little difference. After adopting the optimal match, the MLB-MPC with predictive disturbing inputs achieved a great energy-saving ratio of 7.1% for the ACS, which was only less than the MLB-MPC with ideal disturbing inputs by 0.4%. This indicated that exact predictions of disturbances (e.g., cooling load and outdoor wet-bulb temperature) are important for the MLB-MPC. The proposed MLB-MPC framework would provide a method for improving the energy efficiency of ACSs.}

In particular, the integration of weather-dependent renewable energy technologies into energy system optimization models presents new challenges to computational tractability that cannot only be solved by advancements in computational resources. In consequence, energy system modelers must tackle the complexity of their models by applying various methods to manipulate the underlying data and model structure, with the ultimate goal of finding optimal solutions. As which complexity reduction method is suitable for which research question is often unclear, herein we review different approaches for handling complexity. We first analyze the determinants of complexity and note that many drivers of complexity could be avoided a priori with a tailored model design. Second, we conduct a review of systematic complexity reduction methods for energy system optimization models, which can range from simple linearization performed by modelers to sophisticated multi-level approaches combining aggregation and decomposition methods. Based on this overview, we develop a guide for energy system modelers who encounter computational limitations.}

ABSTRACT = {Recently, multistep-ahead prediction has attracted much attention in electric load forecasting because it can deal with sudden changes in power consumption caused by various events such as fire and heat wave for a day from the present time. On the other hand, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, can reflect the previous point well to predict the current point. Due to this property, they have been widely used for multistep-ahead prediction. The GRU model is simple and easy to implement; however, its prediction performance is limited because it considers all input variables equally. In this paper, we propose a short-term load forecasting model using an attention based GRU to focus more on the crucial variables and demonstrate that this can achieve significant performance improvements, especially when the input sequence of RNN is long. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed model outperforms other recent multistep-ahead prediction models in the building-level power consumption forecasting.},

Since not all consumption events can be linearly described, non-linear models based on fuzzy systems and neural networks are successful where linear models either become inaccurate or too complex to be employed in practice. Herein, we study the adequacy of plain-designed non-linear models to predict energy consumption in a real-world Intelligent Building setting by using simple predictor variables such as time-of-day, weather conditions, and occupancy as estimated from WiFi traffic. The developed Fuzzy Systems and Neural Network models achieve considerably better performance and accuracy indexes than linear regression models, with VAFs equal to 79.3% and 75.7% respectively, and MAE of 5.9 and 7.1kWh, respectively, against 36.6% VAF and 12.8kWh MAE for linear regression models, thus demonstrating that low complexity non-linear models can be used to accurately describe energy consumption baselines in Intelligent Buildings.}

Three common data-driven models are used to predict city-scale daily electricity usage: linear regression models, machine learning models for time series data, and machine learning models for tabular data. In this study, we developed and compared seven data-driven models: (1) five-parameter change-point model, (2) Heating/Cooling Degree Hour model, (3) time series decomposed model implemented by Facebook Prophet, (4) Gradient Boosting Machine implemented by Microsoft lightGBM, and (5) three widely-used machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network). Seven models are applied to the city-scale electricity usage data for three metropolitan areas in the United States: Sacramento, Los Angeles, and New York. Results show seven models can predict the metropolitan area's daily electricity use, with a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) less than 10%. The lightGBM provides the most accurate results, with CVRMSE on the test dataset of 6.5% for Los Angeles, 4.6% for Sacramento, and 4.1% for the New York metropolitan area. These models are further applied to explore how extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves) and unexpected public health events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) influence each city's electricity demand. Results show weather-sensitive component accounts for 30%–50% of the total daily electricity usage. Every degree Celsius ambient temperature increase in summer leads to about 5% (4.7% in Los Angeles, 6.2% in Sacramento, and 5.1% in New York) more daily electricity usage compared with the base load in the three metropolitan areas. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced city-scale electricity demand: compared with the pre-pandemic same months in 2019, daily electricity usage during the 2020 pandemic decreased by 10% in April and started to rebound in summer.}

To address the insufficient generalization ability of current cooling load prediction models especially in the small sample learning, this paper established a physics-based multiple linear regression (PB-MLR) model, which has the advantages of strong generalization ability under small sample learning, short training time, and strong interpretability. The generalization ability of PB-MLR is much higher than that of the back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and the multiple linear regression (MLR) (e.g., MAPE is 36.57% and 11.42% lower than that of them, respectively); The training time of PB-MLR is 625 times faster than that of BP-ANN; By using the interpretability of PB-MLR, the total prediction cooling load can be decoupled to obtain the building’s partial cooling loads, which can provide a reference for building’s energy-saving design. To further improve the performance of PB-MLR, this paper applied the online optimization methods to this model. When the online training and the online calibration work together on the model, the model’s performance is greatly improved, such as its MAPE is reduced by 45.45% compared with its offline model. This shows that the PB-MLR has a large potential for performance improvement and is easy to optimize online. Therefore, the online PB-MLR model (optimal MAPE = 2.64%) is particularly applicable in the scenes of the information-poor buildings with insufficient training samples or the renovation buildings with variable load patterns.}

Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically ‘black-box’ models that do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) – a novel attention-based architecture that combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and highlight three practical interpretability use cases of TFT.}

abstract = {Short-term building cooling load prediction is the essential foundation for many building energy management tasks, such as fault detection and diagnosis, demand-side management and control optimization. Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions. By contrast, data-driven methods have gained huge interests due to their flexibility in model development and the rich data available in modern buildings. The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way. This paper investigates the potential of one of the most promising techniques in advanced data analytics, i.e., deep learning, in predicting 24-h ahead building cooling load profiles. Deep learning refers to a collection of machine learning algorithms which are powerful in revealing nonlinear and complex patterns in big data. Deep learning can be used either in a supervised manner to develop prediction models with given inputs and output (i.e., cooling load), or in an unsupervised manner to extract meaningful features from raw data as model inputs. This study exploits the potential of deep learning in both manners, and compares its performance in cooling load prediction with typical feature extraction methods and popular prediction techniques in the building field. The results show that deep learning can enhance the performance of building cooling load prediction, especially when used in an unsupervised manner for constructing high-level features as model inputs. Using the features extracted by unsupervised deep learning as inputs for cooling load prediction can evidently enhance the prediction performance. The findings are enlightening and could bring more flexible and effective solutions for building energy predictions.}
